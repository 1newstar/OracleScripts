There are a couple of files in here named *.cmd.txt. They should be renamed to *.cmd. The reason for the .txt 
additional extension is simple, SharePoint will not let a *.bat, *.cmd, *.exe etc executable file be uploaded.

	dbClone.cmd - Clone a database. Run "dbClone help" for details.

	dbRefresh.cmd - Refresh a database from Production Dumps. Run "dbRefresh help" for details.
