=====================
SOP - Server Patching
=====================

Abstract
========

This document outlines the steps to be followed in order to carry out
Operating System patching of an Azure database server configured as part
of a Data Guard Primary/Standby database pair. Additionally, there may be a DR
server and database to be patched.

The process outlined should allow patching to be carried out with
minimal downtime for the applications and databases, however, some
downtime is inevitable.


Important â€“ RMAN Backup Tasks
=============================

When patching is in progress, or has completed, the database server,
whichever one it happens to be, running as the primary server, must have
the Windows Task Scheduler's RMAN Backup Tasks enabled. These will run
at pre-determined times of the day to carry out RMAN backups of the
various databases.

The servers running as standby or DR during and after patching, must
have their task scheduler backup tasks disabled. We only run the backups
on the primary servers in production and pre-production.


Patch the Current STANDBY Server
================================

As the current PRIMARY is in use for the applications, the STANDBY
server should be patched first.


Disable the STANDBY Processing
------------------------------

Log in to the PRIMARY database and disable log shipping to the standby.
The following will generate a command that must be executed on the
primary database to prevent updates being applied to the current
standby:

..  code-block:: sql

    select 'alter system set ' ||
    replace(dest_name,'DEST_','DEST_STATE_') ||
    '=''DEFER'' scope=memory;'
    from v$archive_dest_status
    where upper(db_unique_name) = 'STANDBY_DATABASE_NAME_UPPER_CASE';

The command generated will resemble the following:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter system set LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_2='DEFER' scope=memory;

You should leave any other log destinations alone. These would usually
include the DR server at a separate location, and would normally be on
``LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_3``.

Log into the STANDBY database and cancel managed recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database cancel;

Shutdown the STANDBY database:

..  code-block:: sql

    shutdown immediate
    exit

    
Disable the STANDBY Listener
----------------------------

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl stop

    
Patch the STANDBY Server
------------------------

Patch the server. Rebooting as often as required! Frequently.


Restart the STANDBY listener
----------------------------

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl start

    
Startup the STANDBY database
----------------------------

You may need to start the service after a server reboot:

..  code-block:: batch

    net start OracleService<StandbyDB>

You can ignore errors if it reports the service as already running. The
database can now be started.

..  code-block:: sql

    sqlplus sys/password as sysdba

    startup MOUNT

    
Reenable log shipping at the PRIMARY database
---------------------------------------------

Login to the PRIMARY database and enable log shipping:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 2 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2='ENABLE' scope=memory;

    
Startup the STANDBY database
----------------------------

..  code-block:: sql

    startup MOUNT

The STANDBY database should now automatically start fetching and
applying archived logs from the PRIMARY database without any further
input from the DBA. However, this *must* be checked, first on the
PRIMARY database:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 2 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    select gap_status from v$archive_dest_status
    where dest_id = 2;

    GAP_STATUS
    ----------
    NO GAP

Optionally, on the STANDBY server. Locate the alert log, which will
be found in::

    c:\OracleDatabase\diag\rdbms\<standbydb>\<standbydb>\trace\alert*.log

and open it in Notepad++ (or, Notepad, if you really must!)

Go to the end of the file and search backwards for the following
text:

..  code-block::

    Completed: ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE
    THROUGH ALL SWITCHOVER DISCONNECT USING CURRENT LOGFILE

If not found, *and* the PRIMARY showed that a GAP existed, even
after a few minutes waiting, you should manually restart managed
recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database
    using current logfile disconnect;

    
Switchover to the Current STANDBY Database
==========================================

Now that the STANDBY database is up and running on a patched server,
it needs to be running as the PRIMARY in order that the current
PRIMARY server can be patched.

Switchover the databases so that the current STANDBY becomes the new
PRIMARY. This will incur a small downtime, so the applications
should be logged out of for the duration of the switchover.

On either the PRIMARY or STANDBY server, use dgmgrl to facilitate
the switchover as described in the document "*SOP_DataGuardFailover*" 
which can be found in the same TFS location as this document.

In summary:

Set the Oracle environment to the appropriate database (depending on
which server you are on) and log into dgmgrl as the sys user, with a
password:

..  code-block::

    dgmgrl sys/password

Check the configuration currently running:

..  code-block::

    show configuration

Switchover to the listed standby database:

..  code-block::

    switchover to current_standby

There are, however, a number of advisable checks that should be carried
out first, these are detailed in the above mentioned document.


Patch the Current PRIMARY Server
================================

This is exactly the same process as patching the previously running
STANDBY server. The database and applications should be running on the
other server by now, so the patching process can begin.


Disable the *New* STANDBY Processing
------------------------------------

Log in to the *new* PRIMARY database and disable log shipping to the
*new* standby. The following will generate a command that must be executed on
the *new* primary database to prevent updates being applied to the *new*
standby:

..  code-block:: sql

    select 'alter system set '||
    replace(dest_name,'DEST_','DEST_STATE_')||
    '=''DEFER'' scope=memory;'
    from v$archive_dest_status
    where upper(db_unique_name) = 
    'OLD_PRIMARY_DATABASE_NAME_UPPER_CASE';

The command generated will resemble the following:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter system set LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_2='DEFER' scope=memory;

You should leave any other log destinations alone. These would usually
include the DR server as a separate target location, and would normally
be on ``LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_3``.

Log into the *new* STANDBY database and cancel managed recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database cancel;

Shutdown the *new* STANDBY database:

..  code-block:: sql

    shutdown immediate
    exit

    
Disable the *New* STANDBY Listener
----------------------------------

Shutdown the listener:

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl stop

    
Patch the *New* STANDBY Server
------------------------------

Patch the server. Rebooting as often as required! Frequently.


Restart the *New* STANDBY listener
----------------------------------

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl start

    
Startup the *New* STANDBY database
----------------------------------

You may need to start the service after a server reboot:

..  code-block:: batch

    net start OracleService<NewStandbyDB>

You can ignore errors if it reports the service as already running. The
database can now be started.

..  code-block:: sql

    startup MOUNT

    
Reenable log shipping at the *New* PRIMARY database
---------------------------------------------------

Login to the *new* PRIMARY database and enable log shipping:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 2 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    alter system set log_archive_dest_state_2='ENABLE' scope=memory;

    
Startup the *New* STANDBY database
----------------------------------

..  code-block:: sql

    startup MOUNT

The *new* STANDBY database should now automatically start fetching
and applying archived logs from the *new* PRIMARY database without
any further input from the DBA. However, this *must* be checked,
first on the *new* PRIMARY database:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 2 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    select gap_status from v$archive_dest_status
    where dest_id = 2;

    GAP_STATUS
    ----------
    NO GAP

Optionally, on the *new* STANDBY server. Locate the alert log, which
will be found in::

    c:\OracleDatabase\diag\rdbms\<standbydb>\<standbydb>\trace\alert*.log

and open it in Notepad++ (or, Notepad, if you really must!)

Go to the end of the file and search backwards for the following
text:

..  code-block::

    Completed: ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE
    THROUGH ALL SWITCHOVER DISCONNECT USING CURRENT LOGFILE

If not found, *and* the *new* PRIMARY showed that a GAP existed,
even after a few minutes waiting, you should manually restart
managed recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database
    using current logfile disconnect;

    
Patch the Current DR Server
===========================


Disable the DR Processing
-------------------------

Log in to the PRIMARY database and disable log shipping to the DR database.
The following will generate a command that must be executed on the new
primary database to prevent updates being applied to the current
DR database:

..  code-block:: sql

    select 'alter system set '||
    replace(dest_name,'DEST_','DEST_STATE_')||
    '=''DEFER'' scope=memory;'
    from v$archive_dest_status
    where upper(db_unique_name) = 'DR_DATABASE_NAME_UPPER_CASE';

The command generated will resemble the following:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter system set LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_STATE_3='DEFER' scope=memory;

You should leave any other log destinations alone. These would usually
include the usual standby server at a separate location, and would
normally be on ``LOG_ARCHIVE_DEST_2``.

Log into the DR database and cancel managed recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database cancel;

Shutdown the DR database:

..  code-block:: sql

    shutdown immediate
    exit

    
Disable the DR Listener
-----------------------

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl stop

    
Patch the DR Server
-------------------

Patch the server. Rebooting as often as required! Frequently.


Restart the DR listener
-----------------------

..  code-block:: batch

    lsnrctl start

    
Startup the DR database
-----------------------

You may need to start the service after a server reboot:

..  code-block:: sql

    net start OracleService<NewStandbyDB>

You can ignore errors if it reports the service as already running. The
database can now be started.

..  code-block:: sql

    sqlplus sys/password as sysdba

    startup MOUNT

    
Reenable log shipping at the PRIMARY database
---------------------------------------------

Login to the PRIMARY database and enable log shipping:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 3 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    alter system set log_archive_dest_state_3='ENABLE' scope=memory;

    
Startup the DR database
-----------------------

    startup MOUNT

The DR database should now automatically start fetching and applying
archived logs from the PRIMARY database without any further input
from the DBA. However, this *must* be checked, first on the PRIMARY
database:

..  code-block:: sql

    -- Make sure that 3 below is the correct DEST_ID.
    select gap_status from v$archive_dest_status
    where dest_id = 3;

    GAP_STATUS
    ----------
    NO GAP

Optionally, on the DR server. Locate the alert log, which will be
found in::

    c:\OracleDatabase\diag\rdbms\<drdb>\<drdb>\trace\alert*.log
    
and open it in Notepad++ (or, Notepad, if you really must!)

Go to the end of the file and search backwards for the following
text:

..  code-block::

    Completed: ALTER DATABASE RECOVER MANAGED STANDBY DATABASE 
    THROUGH ALL SWITCHOVER DISCONNECT USING CURRENT LOGFILE

If not found, *and* the PRIMARY showed that a GAP existed, even
after a few minutes waiting, you should manually restart managed
recovery:

..  code-block:: sql

    alter database recover managed standby database
    using current logfile disconnect;
